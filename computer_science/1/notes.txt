-- complexity --
Unless specified otherwise, assume worst case

Time complexity if we have no loops and just do something and return: O(1)

Time complexity of a single loop: O(n)

Time complexity of m nested loops: O(n^m)

Time complexity of m singly-nested loops in series: O(n)

-- recursion -- 
when something is defined in terms of itself
